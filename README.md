#  Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization, and it actually summarizes in the form of project all materials that have been learned during this specialization.
# Project Background
The most prosperous business of the commercial space age, SpaceX has reduced the cost of space travel. On its website, the company promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches, which are advertised for a cost of 62 million dollars. By comparison, other companies charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. So, if we can figure out whether the first stage will land, we can figure out how much a launch will cost. We are going to make a prediction about whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage based on available data and machine learning models.

# Queries to be answered 
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
# Methodology
  ### 1. Data collection methodology
  - Using SpaceX Rest API
  - Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
  ### 2. Performed data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
  ### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
 - Creating, modification, and assessing categorization models to get the best outcomes.
